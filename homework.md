- What is a Middleware? Why do we need it?
  A middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware functions can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

        Why do we need middleware?

        To perform common tasks like logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, error handling, etc.
        To keep code modular and reusable by separating concerns.
        To process requests in a sequence, allowing each middleware to handle a specific responsibility before passing control to the next.

        app.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log('Request received');
        next(); // Passes control to the next middleware
        });

- How express JS basically handles requests behind the scenes
  When Express.js receives a request, it handles it behind the scenes as follows:

            Incoming Request:
            The HTTP request arrives at the Express server.

            Middleware Stack:
            Express maintains a stack (list) of middleware and route handlers. Each middleware function can process the request, modify it, or pass it along.

            Routing:
            Express checks each middleware and route in order. If a route matches the request path and method, its handler is called.

            Request/Response Objects:
            Express creates req (request) and res (response) objects for each request, which are passed to all middleware and route handlers.

            Calling next():
            Middleware functions call next() to pass control to the next function in the stack. If a middleware ends the response (with res.send(), res.json(), etc.), the cycle stops.

            Response Sent:
            Once a response is sent, Express finishes processing the request.

            Summary:
            Express processes requests by passing them through a chain of middleware and route handlers, allowing you to handle, modify, or respond to requests at each step.
